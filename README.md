# Heart-Valve-Segmentor

## To do
- [x] Look at data
- [x] Create a GitLab-repo
- [x] make DataLoader faster
- [x] (Work with MONAI)
- [x] Find work-around of using differently structured labels (background is last, instead of first label)
- [ ] Train **[nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet)** to segment the heart valves ~~-> DynUNet (monai implementation of nnU-Net) "Project Monai folder on GitLab. Runs but takes 22 min for validation"~~
- [x] Create the tutorial on how to create the dataset.
- [x] Create full size dataset (with all the data)
- [ ] Run the dataset through the preprocessing of nnUNet full size dataset (with all the data) **currently running**
- [x] What is brilliant is that the data is sometimes flawed - some of the datasets are mismatched in form of having different files where the coordinate system has been different than for others. -> finally solved (every segmentation matches to the volume. Was a hassle.)
- [ ] Take out all the files with the "mismatched voxels", so there are lots of clean images.
- find out which configuration to train the model on (2d, 3d_fullres, 3d_lowres). 
- [ ] Think about using "only heart" or "only thorax" or ... images. According to Helene, nnUNet doesn't get on well with multiple modalities.



Later:
- [ ] Train a 3D-landmark detector to detect the landmarks
- [ ] Deploy the trained models to Specto
- [ ] Write and complete the README file.

### Training on small "test"-Dataset
- [x] 2D U-Net: Fold 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- [x] 3D full resolution U-Net: 0
- [ ] 3D full resolution U-Net: 1, 2, 3, 4
- [ ] 3D full resolution U-Net: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- [ ] 3D U-Net cascade: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- [ ] 3D full resolution U-Net: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

### Goal: **FIND BEST CONFIGURATION**

## README:
### Description
This project aims to segment the heart into five segments and also to detect landmarks in CT scans of hearts, anonymized and provided by the [University Hospital of Basel](https://www.unispital-basel.ch/).

The segments are:
- LVOT
- RCC
- LCC
- NCC
- BG

The landmarks are:
- Commissure LCC-RCC
- Commissure LCC-NCC
- Commissure NCC-RCC
- Nadir RC
- Nadir NC
- Basal NCC-RCC
